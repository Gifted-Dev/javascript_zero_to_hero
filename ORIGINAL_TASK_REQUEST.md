# Original Task Request - JavaScript Course Creation

## 📋 The Original "Crazy Task" Request

**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**User Request:**

> I have a crazy task for you.. I don't know if you are up to it?
> 
> As a professional software developer. I want you to create a comprehensive course that covers everything needed to know in javascript from beginner to advanced. You create a folder called javasript_course. In the course, create sub-folders that covers the important part needed to know with notes and necessary codes. and in the folder, there should be another file for exercises. The course should be divided into parts, each parts should have necessary notes with examples file and exercise file to solidify understanding. I have some listed parts below, you can add to it if you think what I listed below do not cover all that is necessary:
> 
> Part 1 – JavaScript Fundamentals (Beginner Level)
> 
> Part 2 – DOM Manipulation & Web APIs (Intermediate Level)
> 
> Part 3 – ES6+ & Advanced JavaScript Concepts
> 
> Part 4 – Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await, Fetch)
> 
> Part 5 – JavaScript in the Browser (Projects, Events, Forms, Storage)
> 
> Part 6 – JavaScript Modules, Tooling & Debugging
> 
> Part 7 – OOP, Functional JS & Design Patterns
> 
> Part 8 – Final Projects: Build Full Web Apps (Vanilla JS)
> 
> Optional: JavaScript + Frameworks (React, etc.)
