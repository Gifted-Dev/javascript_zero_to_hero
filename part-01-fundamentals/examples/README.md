# Part 1 Examples: How to Study This Code

Welcome to the examples for Part 1! This folder contains working code that demonstrates all the fundamental JavaScript concepts from the `notes.md` file.

Follow this guide to study the code effectively and without confusion.

## üéØ The Goal

The goal here is to see the concepts from the notes in action. You will learn how to:
- Run basic JavaScript code.
- Observe the output of different data types, operators, functions, and arrays.
- Understand how to structure simple scripts.

## üìÇ File Breakdown

There are two key files here:

1.  **`variables-and-data-types.js`**: Covers the absolute basics like `let`, `const`, strings, numbers, booleans, and operators.
2.  **`functions-and-arrays.js`**: Covers more complex topics like creating functions, and using powerful array methods.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Recommended Study Procedure

Follow these steps for a structured learning experience:

1.  **Read the Notes First**: Before touching the code, make sure you have read through the main `notes.md` file for Part 1. This gives you the theoretical foundation.

2.  **Choose How to Run the Code**: You have two main options:
    -   **Browser Console (Easiest)**: Open your web browser, press `F12` to open the developer tools, and go to the "Console" tab. You can copy and paste the code from the `.js` files directly into the console and press Enter to see the results.
    -   **Node.js (More professional)**: If you have Node.js installed, open your terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash), navigate to this `examples` directory, and run the command `node variables-and-data-types.js`.

3.  **Go Section by Section**: The example files are organized with numbered comments. Don't try to read it all at once!

    ```javascript
    // 1. VARIABLE DECLARATION
    // ... code for this section ...

    // 2. DATA TYPES
    // ... code for this section ...
    ```

4.  **Connect the Dots**: For each section in the file:
    -   **Read the Code**: Look at the JavaScript code for that specific concept.
    -   **Predict the Output**: Before running it, try to guess what `console.log()` will print.
    -   **Run and Verify**: Run the code and compare the actual output to your prediction.

5.  **Experiment!** The best way to learn is by doing.
    -   Change a variable's value and see how it affects the output.
    -   Write your own `console.log()` statements to check the value of a variable at a certain point.
    -   Try calling a function with different arguments.

By following this step-by-step process, you can master the fundamentals with confidence.

Happy coding! üöÄ
